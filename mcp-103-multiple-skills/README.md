# MCP 103 â€“ Advanced Connections

**Objective:**  
Integrate multiple MCP servers for an advanced challenge by combining data from GitHub with an AI service to generate creative outputs (e.g., a song).

**Overview:**  
This chapter demonstrates how to fetch a commit summary from GitHub and use it to generate a song via an external service. The sample code is implemented in Python, and the tool functions are decorated with `@mcp.tool` for auto-detection.

## MCP JSON Configuration Example

Below is an example configuration snippet for running the MCP server with uv. Adjust the file paths according to your platform:

```json
{
  "cursor": { "file": "MCP 103 - Advanced Connections/code.py" },
  "claude": { "file": "MCP 103 - Advanced Connections/code.py" },
  "cline": { "file": "MCP 103 - Advanced Connections/code.py" }
}
```
