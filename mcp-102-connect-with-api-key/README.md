# MCP 102 â€“ Environment Variables & Online Services

**Objective:**  
Learn to work with environment variables and connect to an online image analysis service.

**Overview:**  
This chapter demonstrates how to use environment variables (e.g., API keys) to securely interact with an external image analysis service. The sample code is implemented in Python, and the tool function is decorated with `@mcp.tool` for auto-detection.

## MCP JSON Configuration Example

Below is an example configuration snippet for running the MCP server with uv. Adjust the file paths according to your platform:

```json
{
  "cursor": { "file": "MCP 102 - Environment Variables & Online Services/code.py" },
  "claude": { "file": "MCP 102 - Environment Variables & Online Services/code.py" },
  "cline": { "file": "MCP 102 - Environment Variables & Online Services/code.py" }
}
```
